## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r USDA}
USDA = read.csv("USDA.csv")
summary(USDA)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
hist(USDA$Calories)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
