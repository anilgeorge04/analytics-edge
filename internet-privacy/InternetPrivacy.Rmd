# Introduction {.tabset .tabset-fade}
What do many internet users feel about their anonymity, privacy and security online? Often it is interesting to go back in time and analyze the data from the past. According to the [mind boggling internet growth from 1984-2013](https://bitrebels.com/technology/mind-boggling-internet-growth-1984-2013/), the global internet population crossed 2 billion people in 2012!

For this analysis, I've picked up a 2013 user interview open dataset from Pew Research Center.

- What did users care about and feel back then about their privacy online?
- What steps were users taking then to control their security and anonymity?
- How similar or different is the pattern today?

Telephone interviews were conducted (in English) by Princeton Survey Research Associates International from 11-14 July 2013, among a sample of 1,002 adults ages 18 and older.

Here is a short analysis of the survey response data.

## Data Sample
**Data Source**: July 2013 Pew Internet and American Life Project Poll on Internet Anonymity and Privacy
```{r}
# Read data into Poll dataframe
poll = read.csv('raw-data/AnonymityPoll.csv')
# Imported Sample
head(poll, 10)
```

## Structure
```{r}
# Structure of raw data
str(poll)
```

## Raw Summary
```{r Summary Stats, paged.print=TRUE}
# Summary
summary(poll)
```
## Smartphone Users

- 0: Does not use smartphone
- 1: Uses a smartphone
```{r}
table(poll$Smartphone)

```
From previous Summary tab we see that 43 users have a missing value. 43+472+487=1002 responders.

# Analysis

- Demographic distribution of the responders
- Internet and Smartphone usage

## Distribution {.tabset .tabset-fade}
Study distribution of responders by State, Region and Sex.

### Midwest
```{r}
table(subset(poll, Region=="Midwest")$State)
```
### Northeast
```{r}
table(subset(poll, Region=="Northeast")$State)
```
### South
```{r}
table(subset(poll, Region=="South")$State)
```

### West
```{r}
table(subset(poll, Region=="West")$State)
```

### Sex by Region
```{r}
table(poll$Sex, poll$Region)
```
Fairly distributed population across the biological sex and regions in the United States.

## Internet & Smartphone Usage
Many of the response variables (Info.On.Internet, Worry.About.Info, Privacy.Importance, Anonymity.Possible, and Tried.Masking.Identity) were not collected if a responder does not use the Internet or a smartphone. So these variables have missing values for these responders.


# Results

# Conclusion
